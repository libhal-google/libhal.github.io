# `dac` interface design

See [DAC interface
API](https://libhal.github.io/libhal/api/classhal_1_1dac.html) for details on
the interface and how to use it.

`dac` is effectively the same design as ADC but as an output device and thus
shares the same design rationale as ADC.

See [design/adc](adc.md) for details.
