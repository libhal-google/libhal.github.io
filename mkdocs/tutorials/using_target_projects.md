# Using target libraries

## ðŸ“‘ Reference Material

Reference material can be found in the `datasheets/` and `schematic/` folders.
The layout of these directories match that `demos/`, where the first layer of
folders are named after the microcontroller or board they describe.

These folders are updated with relevant documents for easy access for our
developers and contributors.
