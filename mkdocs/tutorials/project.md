# ðŸš€ Starting a Project

!!! note
    There is only 1 requirements for a project that uses libhal and that is
    making the `libhal.tweaks.hpp` file exists and that it is set correctly.
    Otherwise `libhal` can be used like any other header only library.

To start a project, it is recommended to simply copy the contents of
[libhal-start](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-starter).

More details about the standard layout of a project coming soon.
