# üóÉÔ∏è Organization

This section will explain the different parts/repos of libhal organization and
ecosystem and how they are organized.

## Target Libraries

Target libraries depend on processor/OS libraries. The target libraries will
include drivers for peripherals contained within their chip packages or, in
the case of development boards and SBC (single board computers), these can also
contain drivers external to the main chip. Processor/OS libraries contain
APIs specific to those platforms for doing such things as handling interrupt
service routines, initializing memory and more.

    end
    subgraph linux-targets
      libhal-linux-generic
      libraspi
    end

    libhal-->libarmcortex

    libarmcortex-->liblpc40xx
    libarmcortex-->libstm32f10x

    libriscvmcu-->libgv32f10x
    libriscvmcu-->libsifive

    libhal-linux-->libhal-linux-generic
    libhal-linux-->libraspi
```

## Device Libraries

Device driver libraries have a very simple relationship tree. Device libraries
just need the libhal interfaces to work. The implementations of those interfaces
will come from a target library in the application.

    libhal-->libhal-soft
    libhal-->libmpu
    libhal-->libesp8266
    libhal-->libdrv
    libhal-->libwii
    libhal-->liballegro-micro
    libhal-->libdisplay-ssd
    libhal-->libled-apa-sk
    libhal-->libmatrix
```

## Typical Application

Lets consider an application such as "Pong". A game of pong where we use an
LED matrix and two Wii controllers using the STM32F103 microcontroller.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    libhal-->libmatrix-->app
    libhal-->libarmcortex-->libstm32f10x -->app
    libhal-->libwii-->app
```

The `conanfile.txt` would look something like this:

```
[requires]
libstm32f10x/1.1.0
libmatrix/1.0.2
libwii/1.5.2

[generators]
CMakeToolchain
CMakeDeps
VirtualRunEnv
```

## Application Libraries

Application libraries are effectively applications with no specific dependency
on a particular target. The point of a Application library is to deploy a fully
fledged application, but with customizable drivers. For example, the pong game
mentioned earlier doesn't require a wii controller or a LED matrix specifically.
You could take a `hal::display` interface (not currently available) and some
`pong::gamepad` interface defined by the Application library that the developer
can implement themselves. Then the pong Application can take your display,
gamepad and additional information like, "paddle size" and "font size" and use
it to generate a game of pong. The developer gets the opportunity to choose
which parts they want for each. Maybe they want a very large TFT display or they
want to use a LED matrix. Maybe they want to use a Stadia controller or maybe
they want to make a controller out of capacitive sensors and bananas. The
choices are endless.

## üîç Finding Drivers

To find drivers you can look in three locations

- [libhal](https://github.com/libhal/libhal) organization
- [conan center](https://conan.io/center/) index
- [libhal driver index]() ‚ùå

!!! note
    libhal driver index is not available currently and is key to finding
    drivers around the ecosystem.

Search for the name of the device or target you are interested with with the
prefix `lib` in front of it. Try not to be too specific though. For example,
the `stm32f103c8t6` microcontroller target library drivers will be in the
package `libstm32f10x`. The `mpu6050` accelerometer will be in `libmpu`.

## üìë Reference Material

Reference material can be found in the `datasheets/` and `schematic/` folders.
The layout of these directories match that `demos/`, where the first layer of
folders are named after the microcontroller or board they describe.

These folders are updated with relevant documents for easy access for our
developers and contributors.
