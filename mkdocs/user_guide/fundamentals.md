# ðŸ§± Fundamentals of Libhal

Welcome to libhal, a library designed to make hardware drivers portable,
flexible, accessible, and easy to use. libhal provides a foundation for embedded
drivers, allowing those drivers to be used across different processors,
microcontrollers, systems, and devices. The design philosophy of libhal is to be
multi-targeted, lightweight, general, minimalist, safe & reliable, tested &
testable, quickly compiled, and OS agnostic.

## The Basics of libhal

At its core, libhal is a set of interfaces that correspond to hardware devices
and peripherals. These interfaces use runtime polymorphism to decouple
application logic from driver implementation details. This decoupling enables
applications to run on any target device that has the necessary components
available.

For example, consider a blinker program. The required interfaces for such a
program are `hal::output_pin` for controlling the LED and `hal::steady_clock`
for keeping time. Your application can take both of these drivers without having
to consider their implementation details and blink an LED at a specified
interval.

## Types of Libraries

In libhal, libraries are categorized into platform, utility, device, process,
and application/operating system libraries.

- **Platform Libraries**: Contain the driver implementations for specific
  platforms. Every application that uses libhal will need one of these libraries
  in order to work on any hardware.
- **Utility Libraries**: Purely software libraries that help to either make
  performing some work on a device easier for the developer or help to organize
  and bring structure to an application.
- **Device Libraries**: Libraries containing drivers for specific hardware
  devices or modules, such as a sensor, display, or a motor controller. They are
  generally target agnostic and should be usable on any system that can support
  its interface, memory, and performance requirements.
- **Process Libraries**: Code that performs some work. This work usually
  requires one or more drivers in order to work. This is similar to an
  application on a device like a desktop computer or smartphone, but on an
  embedded system.
- **Application/Operating System Libraries**: Full applications that typically
  handle the whole system.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are the basic building blocks of libhal and enable the flexibility
needed to be portable and flexible. An interface is a contract of functions that
an implementing class must adhere to. Any software that implements (inherits) an
interface must provide implementations for each function in the interface,
otherwise the compiler will generate a compiler error.

Not all libraries will implement an interface. Some drivers are

## Driver Types

Driver types in libhal include peripheral, device, and soft drivers.

- **Peripheral Drivers**: Drivers for a target that is embedded within the
  device and therefore cannot be removed from the chip and is fixed in number.
- **Device Drivers**: Drivers for devices external to a target. In order to
  communicate with such a device the target must have the necessary peripherals
  and peripheral drivers to operate correctly.
- **Soft Drivers**: Drivers that do not have any specific underlying hardware
  associated with them. They are used to emulate, give context to, or alter the
  behavior of interfaces.

## `hal::result<T>` & `hal::status`

`hal::result<T>` is an alias for the `boost::leaf::result<T>` type. This type
can either be the value T or an error. `hal::status` is simply a concise alias
for the type `boost::leaf::result<void>`. See
[Boost.LEAF](https://boostorg.github.io/leaf/) for more details about it and
how it works.

## `HAL_CHECK()`

`HAL_CHECK()` is a macro that takes an expression that evaluates to a
`hal::result`.

## ðŸ§± Concrete Drivers

In libhal, not all drivers are designed to implement an interface. These
drivers, referred to as "Concrete Drivers", are unique in that they typically do
not contain virtual functions and cannot be passed in a generic form. Despite
this, they play a crucial role in the library due to their specific
functionality and support for certain hardware components.

Concrete Drivers are fully realized classes that provide direct, specific
functionality. They are designed to interact with a particular piece of hardware
or perform a specific task, and their methods provide a direct interface to that
hardware or task. Because they do not implement an interface, they cannot be
used polymorphically like other drivers in libhal. However, their specificity
allows them to provide robust, efficient, and direct control over their
associated hardware.

These drivers are particularly useful in scenarios where a specific piece of
hardware or a specific task does not neatly fit into one of the existing libhal
interfaces, or when the overhead of virtual functions is not desirable. Despite
not conforming to a specific interface, Concrete Drivers adhere to the same
design principles as other components of libhal, ensuring consistency and
reliability across the library.

### Multi-Interface Support

Many Concrete Drivers can actually support multiple interfaces at once. For
example, a driver for the RMD-X6 smart motor can act as a servo, a motor, a
temperature sensor (for itself), a voltage sensor (for the bus it is connected
to), a current sensor (for how much current it's consuming), and a rotation
sensor (for its output shaft's position). To create these drivers from the
concrete driver, an adaptor class must be used. These adaptor classes take the
concrete class and use its methods in order to implement the interface APIs.

### Adaptor Factory Functions

In libhal, there is a common language policy for adaptors. To create them you
must call a factory function called `make_<name of interface>()` and it will
return a `hal::result<adaptor_object>`. There is an overload for every driver
that implements a particular interface. For example, in order to generate a
servo from an RMD X6 servo object, it would look like this:

```C++
auto smart_servo_driver = HAL_CHECK(make_servo(rmd_x6_driver));
```

This approach allows for a consistent and efficient way to create adaptors for
various interfaces from a single concrete driver. It ensures that the concrete
driver can be utilized to its full potential, providing access to all its
capabilities through the appropriate interfaces.
