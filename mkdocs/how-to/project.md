# ðŸ†• Creating a new Project

To start a project, it is recommended to simply copy the contents of
[libhal-start](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-starter).

The project README will explain:

- Building using CMake
- Supporting multiple targets
- Unit Testing

The instructions mentioned here will only include the steps for using CMake, but
should be the same for other build systems.
